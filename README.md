# String-Calculator-TDD
Calculates sum of numbers present in string separated by delimiter. For ex : "1,5" will equal 6

It takes numbers as string separated by delimiter. The default delimiter is comma(,).

It also handles newline between numbers "1\n2,4" (will equal 7).

To change the delimiter we need to pass //[delimiter]\n in the start of the string
